<h1 align="center">Solving the Heat Diffusion Equation with Python 🐍🔥</h1>

## ⇰ Description 
This project implements and analyzes numerical methods for solving the heat diffusion (Poisson) equation using the finite difference method (FDM). The goal is to model the temperature distribution in a conductive medium under a variety of boundary conditions and conductivity models.
